# SpaceAlert
The Space Alert is mobile application, which was written during the hackathon - "Rzethon by G2A". 
The main assumption of this app is help to spaceman during the space mission. 
The cosmonaut that is equipped with such functionality, constantly monitors its vital data, as well as condition of his space suit, 
and in case of danger, one click he can call for help, by sending information to the crew, e.g. on board. 
This project was created in a 4-person group, where two people were responsible for writing a server that served messages, 
sent by the SpaceAlert app, using UDP packets. 
The other two people (me and Piotr - a link to his github profile below), we wrote, described above, mobile application.  
Because (me and Piotr) have written this app together, I leave link to his github profile: https://github.com/PPalac
